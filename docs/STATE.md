# STATE — khatm-platform
> Updated at the end of EVERY Claude Code session. This file is the session anchor.

## Current phase / task
- Phase 0 — Production Foundation
- Active task: KH-0.2.1 (Flyway V1__baseline enterprise schema) — DONE, all §5 acceptance
  criteria green (`mvn verify` passes: Spotless, Checkstyle, Modulith boundaries, 8/8 tests)
- 2026-07-14: housekeeping pass (approved architecture-review decisions) applied on top of
  KH-0.2.1 — see "Last completed" and "Decisions made" below. No WBS feature work this
  session.
- Branch ready for review: `feat/KH-0.2.1-baseline-schema`, rebased onto `main` (KH-0.1.1 is
  now merged — PR #1, squash commit `dfde818`). Toolchain is now Java 21. Full build green,
  not yet pushed — awaiting review before push (session ended by request).

## Last completed
- 2026-07-14: Housekeeping (approved architecture-review decisions, no WBS feature work)
  - Rebased `feat/KH-0.2.1-baseline-schema` onto updated `main` (KH-0.1.1 merged via PR #1).
    Trivial — git recognized `3713499` was already incorporated as squash commit `dfde818`
    and skipped it, replaying only the KH-0.2.1 commit. Zero conflicts.
  - Upgraded toolchain to Java 21: `pom.xml` `java.version` + `maven.compiler.release` both
    `21`. Installed Eclipse Temurin 21.0.11 (`winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.21.JDK`).
    Verified with `mvn clean verify` under `JAVA_HOME` pointed at the new JDK: BUILD SUCCESS,
    8/8 tests, and confirmed compiled class files are major version 65 (Java 21) via `javap`.
    No Java 18–21 language features adopted in existing code (toolchain-only change).
  - Added `@org.springframework.modulith.ApplicationModule` to the 8 modules that lacked it
    (tenant, schema, status, ledger, holder, consumer, rbac, connector) — all 11 modules now
    carry the annotation consistently. `ModulithBoundariesTest` stays green.
  - Extracted `CredentialService#toView` into a new `CredentialMapper` class
    (`credential/domain/CredentialMapper.java`, module-private, injects `SchemaCatalog` to
    resolve `schemaCode`) per CONVENTIONS.md §5's manual-mapper-class rule. No behavior
    change — same 8/8 tests green.
  - `docs/STATE.md`: split "Decisions made" into per-session subsections, deleted the stale
    "`ddl-auto: update` kept" line (false since KH-0.2.1), moved 3 durable conventions to
    `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` (entity visibility, Checkstyle logger/MethodName exceptions, new
    spring-modulith-upgrade DDL-diff rule).
  - `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`: added the 3 moved conventions (§2, §5, §6) plus a new PR rule
    (§9) requiring same-PR concurrency/correctness tests for core invariant logic changes,
    effective 2026-07-13.
  - `specs/FS-0.2-database-baseline.md` status header updated to note §5.7 (error-codes.md)
    is partially deferred to KH-0.6 — approved 2026-07-13.
  - Inspected `claim_code.disclosures_enc`: confirmed unencrypted (in fact entirely unset,
    not just plaintext) — logged as an open blocker below rather than implemented, per
    instructions.
- 2026-07-13: KH-0.2.1 — Flyway V1__baseline enterprise schema
  - `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__baseline.sql`: all 13 business tables from
    `specs/FS-0.2-database-baseline.md` (tenant, issuer_key, credential_schema, holder,
    status_list, credential, claim_code, consuming_party(+_schema), consumption_event,
    app_user, role, user_role, audit_log) + Spring Modulith's official `event_publication`
    schema (copied verbatim from `spring-modulith-events-jdbc:1.2.4`). Seeds the default
    tenant + 3 default roles (PLATFORM_ADMIN, TENANT_ADMIN, ISSUER_OPERATOR).
  - `ddl-auto: validate` is now live; Flyway (`flyway-core` + `flyway-database-postgresql`
    + `spring-modulith-starter-jdbc`) is the only schema source.
  - New shared infra: `LocalizedText`/`LocalizedTextConverter` (the one JPA converter for
    every `name_i18n`/`label_i18n` jsonb column), `TenantContext` (fixed default-tenant UUID
    until KH-2.1), `Uuidv7` (D1: app-generated, time-ordered PKs — replaces
    `UUID.randomUUID()` everywhere).
  - Minimal persistence + one find-or-create cross-module method added to 4 previously-stub
    modules: `schema` (`SchemaCatalog#ensurePublished/#findById`), `holder`
    (`HolderDirectory#ensureHolder`), `status` (`StatusListAllocator#allocate`,
    pessimistic-lock based — no `RETURNING`-without-`@Modifying` trick, see decisions below),
    `consumer` (`ConsumingPartyRegistry#ensure`). `tenant` gets a `Tenant` entity + repo only
    (no API — see `TenantContext` above). `rbac` stays a pure stub (tables + seed rows only,
    no Java).
  - `credential` module rewritten to match the new schema end to end: `Credential`,
    `ConsumptionEvent` entities now carry FKs (`schema_id`, `holder_id`, `status_list_id`,
    `consuming_party_id`) instead of denormalized strings; new `ClaimCode` entity/table;
    `CredentialService#issue`/`#consume` orchestrate schema/holder/status/consumer APIs;
    `#issueClaimCode` added. `DemoSeeder` now issues a full document (schema + holder +
    credential + claim_code).
  - 8 tests, all green: `MigrationCleanBootTest`, `DemoSeederIntegrationTest`,
    `ConcurrentConsumeTest` (50 threads, exactly 1 success), `ConsumptionEventIdempotencyTest`
    (duplicate idempotency_key → unique violation), `AuditLogAppendOnlyTest` (UPDATE/DELETE
    rejected by trigger), `TenantNameI18nCheckTest` (missing `ar` → CHECK violation),
    `ModulithBoundariesTest`. All use a Testcontainers Postgres via a singleton-container base
    class (`support/IntegrationTestSupport`) so the suite boots the app once.
  - README.md added to all 11 modules (Work rule 1).
- 2026-07-13: KH-0.1.1 + KH-0.1.2 — Modulith restructure + boundary verification
  - Package layout migrated from `sy.khatm.poc.*` → `sy.khatm.platform.*`
  - All 11 modules created with `package-info.java` (tenant, key, schema, credential,
    status, ledger, holder, consumer, rbac, connector, shared)
  - Spring Modulith 1.2.4 BOM + `spring-modulith-starter-core` + `spring-modulith-starter-test`
  - `ModulithBoundariesTest` (pure bytecode analysis, no DB) — GREEN
  - Spotless 2.43.0 (google-java-format 1.22) — GREEN
  - Checkstyle 3.3.1 — GREEN (custom `checkstyle.xml`)
  - `.editorconfig` added
  - `pom.xml` renamed to `khatm-platform`, Spring Boot 3.3.4 retained

## Decisions made

### Session KH-0.1.1 (2026-07-13)
- **Cross-module key access**: `credential` module depends on `key :: api` (the `KeySigner`
  interface in `key/api/`). `SoftKeyService` in `key/domain/` is module-private.
  Named-interface mechanism: `@NamedInterface("api")` on `key/api/package-info.java`.
- **`credential/api/` named interface**: `@NamedInterface("api")` exposes only DTO records.
  `Credential` entity, `CredentialService`, repositories are module-private (in sub-packages).
- **DemoSeeder placement**: inside `credential/seed/` module, `@Profile({"local","dev"})`.
  Depends directly on `CredentialService` (same module — no API interface needed).

### Session KH-0.2.1 (2026-07-13)
- **UUIDv7 everywhere**: added `shared.Uuidv7` per spec D1; every entity's `id` is now
  app-generated UUIDv7, not `UUID.randomUUID()` (v4).
- **Status-list allocation is pessimistic-lock, not `UPDATE...RETURNING`**: first attempt used
  a native `@Query` with `UPDATE ... RETURNING` and no `@Modifying`, which is a
  known-fragile Spring Data JPA pattern. Switched to `@Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` on the finder
  + plain read-increment-save in `StatusListAllocatorService` — same atomicity guarantee,
  standard Spring Data JPA.
- **Cross-module credential dependencies expanded**: `credential/package-info.java`
  `allowedDependencies` grew from `{key :: api}` to `{key :: api, schema :: api, holder ::
  api, status :: api, consumer :: api, shared}` — issuing/consuming now must resolve every FK
  the baseline schema requires. `shared` is listed by module name alone (no `::`) because
  `LocalizedText`/`TenantContext`/`Uuidv7` live in its open root package, not a named `api`
  sub-package.
- **`ConsumingPartyRegistry#ensure`, `SchemaCatalog#ensurePublished`, `HolderDirectory
  #ensureHolder` are find-or-create, not real onboarding**: real API-key issuance (KH-1.4.3),
  schema authoring (KH-1.x), and holder registration UX (KH-1.x) remain future work. These
  exist only so the baseline schema's `NOT NULL` FKs can be satisfied today.
- **Testcontainers + Docker Desktop 4.58 / Engine 29 compatibility**: Testcontainers
  1.20.1's default docker-java client negotiates an API version too old for Engine 29
  (`MinAPIVersion: 1.44`), which Docker Desktop rejects with an empty-bodied HTTP 400
  instead of a clear error. Fixed via `src/test/resources/docker-java.properties`
  (`api.version=1.44`) — see testcontainers-java issue #11235. If `mvn verify` fails locally
  with "Could not find a valid Docker environment" and `docker info` works fine from a shell,
  this is almost certainly the cause.
- **`docs/error-codes.md` / `ErrorCode` enum NOT created this session**: CLAUDE.md work rule 3
  (exception hierarchy, error envelope) is out of scope for KH-0.2.1 — it's a dedicated future
  task. `shared/README.md` notes this explicitly so it isn't mistaken for an oversight.

### Session Housekeeping (2026-07-14)
- **Java 21, toolchain-only**: bumped per an approved architecture-review decision made
  2026-07-13. **`CLAUDE.md`'s "Stack (frozen)" line still says "Java 17"** — this session was
  scoped to exactly the items requested and did not include editing `CLAUDE.md`; whoever
  reviews this should update that line too, or it will read as a stale contradiction.
- **`CredentialMapper` needs `SchemaCatalog`, not a pure entity→DTO function**: `Credential`
  only stores `schema_id`; `CredentialView` needs the human-readable `schemaCode`. The mapper
  is a `@Component` with constructor-injected `SchemaCatalog`, not a static utility — still
  matches CONVENTIONS.md §5's intent (a dedicated class, not inline mapping in the service).
- **`@ApplicationModule` added with no `allowedDependencies` on the 8 newly-annotated
  modules**: they have no cross-module dependencies today, so the bare annotation is
  sufficient; it only documents the module boundary, it doesn't change enforcement (Modulith
  already treated these as modules structurally, annotated or not).

> Durable conventions formerly logged here (entity visibility, the Checkstyle
> logger/MethodName exceptions) now live in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §2/§5 — this file only
> keeps session-scoped decisions. The stale "`ddl-auto: update` kept" note has been removed
> (superseded by KH-0.2.1: `ddl-auto: validate` is live — see Last completed above).

## Environment facts
- Local: Windows + IntelliJ + Docker Desktop. Shared network `khatm-net` created.
- DB exposed on :5432 for IntelliJ; API on :8080.
- Maven 3.9.9 (must export PATH manually: `export PATH="$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH"`).
- Toolchain is Java 21 (`pom.xml` `java.version`/`maven.compiler.release`). Both JDK 17
  (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`, original) and JDK 21 (Eclipse Temurin,
  `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot`) are installed on this machine;
  `JAVA_HOME` must point at the JDK 21 install for builds to target the right release —
  IntelliJ's project SDK needs updating to JDK 21 separately (not done by this session).
- Default tenant strategy: single default tenant row until KH-2.1 — fixed UUID
  `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, seeded by `V1__baseline.sql`, mirrored in Java as
  `sy.khatm.platform.shared.TenantContext.DEFAULT_TENANT_ID`.
- Docker Desktop on this machine needs `src/test/resources/docker-java.properties`
  (`api.version=1.44`) for Testcontainers to connect at all (see decisions above).

## Open decisions / blockers
- **`claim_code.disclosures_enc` is not AES-GCM encrypted per spec FS-0.2 §3.7 — it is left
  `NULL` entirely.** `CredentialService#issueClaimCode` (called by the local/dev `DemoSeeder`)
  never sets `disclosuresEnc` on the `ClaimCode` it saves; this is stronger than "plaintext in
  the column" (no disclosure data is written at all yet), but the net effect is the same: the
  claim flow cannot currently hand real disclosure values to a wallet. Populating this field
  (post real SD-JWT disclosure extraction), AES-GCM encrypting it, and the expiry-zeroing
  worker that clears it on claim/timeout are all hard requirements of KH-1.2.1 (the worker
  path depends on the ADR-09 worker skeleton, not yet built).

## Next up (ordered)
1. KH-0.2.2 — CI check that fails if an applied Flyway migration file is edited
   (append-only migration discipline; `V1__baseline.sql` must never change after this merges)
2. KH-0.5 KeyProvider SPI (SoftKeyProvider persisting to `issuer_key`, `kid` in JWS) —
   replaces ephemeral in-memory `SoftKeyService`
3. KH-0.4 SD-JWT signing upgrade
4. KH-0.6 Console auth + API-key filter + `rbac`/`shared.audit_log` write path + the
   `KhatmException`/`ErrorCode` hierarchy (CLAUDE.md work rule 3 — still not started)
